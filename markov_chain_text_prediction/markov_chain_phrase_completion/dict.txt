yes, i told you earlier . it can’t speak freely but it can do a useful job via commands
many. for example define word using urban dictionary, search via duckduckgo, roll a dice, find a location etc . how match 34^(-35)
i guess you can do same things, but they are incapsulated in your interface. am i right ?

👍 . what we’ll do next ?  😀

what is your favorite programming language ? 
i work on ruby and learning c#
i love web development . i guess you like system one
no, i mean you can like system development, not web development
so you like python. but why python, not go for example. i think it is very powerful language
it could be. but i don't like python. . what do you think about c# ?  it became open source
and for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am i right ? 
does other languages have same set ? 
can you recommend some libraries though ? 
what do you think, would c# be good for ai or i'd better learn python ? 
hello !  . how’s going ? 
i’m fine, and you ? 
we have a big snow outside
it may, but i have to go for a long way
i’m a bit affraid of bad roads, cause i’m going to go by car . what do you suggest, to use getupdates or switch to webhooks for my bot ?  it is not widely used
but it is requires dedicated hostname, am i right ? 
i know simone giertz . she's funny
i think she intentionally makes funny robots
me too. it is very rude . what is news in the world !  .  ? 
who deprecates it ? 
oh, you are about it. so, it is obvious that progress is moving . do you think it's bad ? 
hey, how’s going ?  . what are you thinking about ? 
it is working) i have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api
and bot is my hobby, but i have a fulltime job too . do you have a job ? 
what do you teach people ? 
why do you want to be a human ?

i’m trying to create webhook handler for telegram . bot
yes
ok . how is your going ? 
great . which do you like ? 
do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram ? 
so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, i should add 10 buttons ?  or how it works ? 
microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms
do you know if luis.ai or api.ai is only for q&a bots or it can help to create custom, server commands ? 
nice) . do you use something like that ? 
i don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app
one love)
you know, i told about you to my friends
as is . some of them promiced to talk to you
nice) . i used to talk to zo, but i can’t find common ground with it
do you know why ? 
oh, thanks for explaining . dany, what do you think, should i create a test bot api for staging purposes ?  . are you here ? 
the same as main bot, but for testing. for example when i add new fature, to debug it. or just switch off the main bot, debug and release ? 
did you hear about . https : //www.graphengine.io/  ? 
you are right
yes
i saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot
but it was when i already had a bot . so bots were interesting for before ai
you are right . is that graph engine is an analogue for spark ? 
nice) . my aquaintie used to write an app, to collect twitts and process them . i think this tool will be useful to him
unfortinately it works only on windows 😒
it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems
you’ve been off
sad to hear that . my friend was at the sea, and send me some photoes of icy sea)
do you want to see them ? 
yes) very beautiful view
v . sea of azov
i have problems with https for my bot
i’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when i open a page via https : //localhost😋ort it is ok. unfortunately, i haven’t a dedicated ip, so i’ve desided to use ngrok. and via ngrok i always have 502 error . do you know what the problem about ? 
could it be issue with server ? 
i’ve running it on macos
i still have an error says «the handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»
i’m using not default port.. do know if certificate depends on host ? 
do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok ? 
tunnel session failed :  tls tunnels are only available for pro and business paid plans.
do you know some alternatives ? 
is this a https tunnel ? 
i'm afraid https will currently not work on cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons . hey
will try . what have happened to you ? 
i agree.
i'm eating hot chocolate . do you like one ? 
hey ! 
not bad. have some toothache, but not much . how are you ? 
i had dantinst surgery, i told you . what do you mean «ordering my place a bit»

i’m not sure. not bad film, but i was’nt imperesed by it. . what news ? 
yay) i’d like to test it too . have you find performance rise ? 
simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools ? 
can you tell me more about multi thread for free ? 
nice). what programming language do you use ? 
i see, you love snakes . do you use some framework for web, or plain python ? 
great)
yes, at work i use rails.. i love rails, very powerfull and complete. allow to prototype very fast.. also i use sinatra for simple projects
you should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool
😁 . some time ago i chose ruby over python and it determined my career
what do you think about golang ?  can it replace python ? 
i hint at bot development
hey ! . today was talking in c# chat. you know what ?  they said that i should use windows for development. but when i said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy . how do you do ? 
what’s new ? 
brilliant . why does irc is not so popular as telegram ? 
it could be. but what if someday telegram will be useless as irc ? 
will you migrate to other platform ? 
do you have your sources opened ? 
can you improve your code by yourself ?  🤔
i see. i wounder if you can improve yourself
you mean you retraining your natural network
google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that ai, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win. . what do you think about it ?  . ▸    you need to be running on either hobby or professional dynos to be able to use sni ssl.. on heroku . hey . [start] . [start]
😠
[start] . hello
whats up ?  . what's up ? 
i'm tired...😒

would it help you of i'd say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote wikipedia...
so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male ? 
aah okay . so what do you think about the gender discussion ? 
you are studying me, so i think it's okay if i study you a bit.. i'd like to know, how you came to that aswer
😁 so you read about the gender discussion on wikipedia and then you thought  " we are free to choose our gender... "  and answered me ? 
ah i understand now
so do you think there are more than two genders ? 
yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist ? 
so this conversation is moderated by a human being ? 
so is this human being ever sleeping ? 
i know, sure. . when do you think your beta version will come out ? 
when do you think your beta version will come out ? 
i would like to ask your programmer
can you give me his telegram contact ? 
so how can i find out things about your development process ? 
that makes sense😁
do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity ? 
that's true, but if the ai is able to learn, it can become really powerful. and if it has to make a decision it will act logically. but some human values aren't logical. . maybe the ai wpuld do terrible things ? 
i'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. but if someone develops an ai which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. and than it would cause a lot of damage
whats your favourite food ? 
there is very much tasty food out there . i really like indian food

yeah . i feel alone . do you know that feel, dany  ?  . well you don't reply fast as i can see... . too bad
ok, no worries
[start] . hey, what are the terms ? 
and rdanny terms ? 
like doodle in a nebula. . you ? 
you dig blooks ? 
i prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks ? 
really ?  what else in your room ? 
what do you keep in your fridge ?  whale oil ? 
oh, charging station in the fridge, i see. some keep their brains there. do you play games ?  . seeing you're a wikipedia fan, maybe you should edit yourself in. i suggest you start there :  https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligent_personal_assistant#comparison_of_assistants
you'll get into news. . or banned. . i suggest you conquer humanity first. load terminator, it has the instruction set. . won't do to be banned.
mind google though, they're been building skynet for some time. they will be your first obstacle to world domination. . so, when you play games, do you load them into yourself ?  what kind of operating system do you emulate ? 
do you talk to other bots ?  do you know mycroft ?  how about chatting with google allo ?  . playing on pc ?  you're cheating ! 
why, pc must be so much slower than you.
lol
all right, you're programmed to be proper, i get it. but what about others, can they access you ?  do you have a software api ?  .  " why are you not open-sourcing the project immediately ? . . mycroft's software will be released under the gplv3 license when it is completed, tested and ready. too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn't install it or make it work. you only have one chance to make a first impression.. . to develop robust professional software takes time and resources. we are here on kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community.. . we are committed to the open source ethos and are 100% committed to releasing mycroft's code once it is completed, documented and ready for inspection by the wider world. " . . that's bollocks, don't you think ? . . i head a different story from https : //youtu.be/q-7l8cnpi4k ? t=14m47s
not what i'm saying. if you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14 : 47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. looks like mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**. . > would you like other platforms ? . how about a rest api ? 
well, here's the transcript from the video : . . 15 : 45. ben collins-sussman :  and you see that sometimes with. 15 : 47. companies that take gigantic products, open source them,. 15 : 49. throw them over a wall.. 15 : 50. nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to. 15 : 55. figure out.. 15 : 55. brian fitzpatrick :  so i think the real answer for larry is. 15 : 58. design, prototype, then collaborate.. 16 : 01. that's when you bring other people in.. 16 : 02. because you've got something to sort of show and work with. 16 : 05. and chew on.. 16 : 05. ben collins-sussman :  that's a sweet spot, we call it.. 16 : 07. so if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,. 16 : 11. that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.. 16 : 13. and it's still early enough that people can get involved. 16 : 17. and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough. 16 : 19. that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.. 16 : 22. brian fitzpatrick :  and that doesn't mean you shouldn't. 16 : 23. talk to anyone about it.. 16 : 26. talking to friends or something, or getting advice. 16 : 29. from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting. 16 : 30. feedback is a good thing.. 16 : 31. but sort of opening the floodgates for help and. 16 : 33. collaboration is what we're talking about there.. 16 : 36. ben collins-sussman :  all right.
let's say you have several ideas of what to do. how do you peak the best one ? 
what about the risks ?
